This repository demonstrates a common Python bug: the ZeroDivisionError that occurs when attempting to divide by zero.  The `average_bug.py` file contains a function that calculates the average of a list of numbers. It is missing error handling for the case of an empty input list.  The `average_solution.py` shows how to correct this with proper error handling by returning 0 in the case of an empty list.
